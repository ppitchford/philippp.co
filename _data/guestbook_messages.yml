    have started to take screenshots of my mobile usage as the screen time data on
    my iPhone doesn&#39;t allow a download of aggregated data! \r\n\r\nCompletely
    agree on how shocking it is to realise how many app&#39;s poke themselves into
    our attention everyday. "

    platform that was going to fit what I was looking for, was a little trepidatious
    about jekyll from scratch, and yours looks super slick! Very happy I found ya

    EVO 250GB 2.5&quot; SATA SSD, a Broadcom 4253 Wifi AC 867Mbps + Bluetooth, and
    recently upgraded thermal paste.  The display panel, bezel, palm wrest, and trackpad
    have all seen better days, but, this thing is a veritable workhorse that won&#39;t
    die!  I have the ultrabase with the key, the external battery charger, and every
    battery aside from the 2-cell but I don&#39;t seem to be missing much there.\r\n\r\nReading
    your blog made me feel happy.  It&#39;s always nice to see other people doing
    the same sorts of things out there!"

  body: Hello, thank you very much for the content, Maxime! Your digital garden template
    was just the one I have been looking for a long time, in Jekyll and having both
    support for wikilinks with spaces in them as well as graph visualization. I just
    really wanted to get that appreciation across to you. Thanks again!

    few months ago and it&#39;s been great. I&#39;ve upgraded it with an SSD, 8GB
    of RAM, and new thermal paste. I can easily use it for all of my schoolwork, along
    with more intensive things like editing videos and using VMs. I made a blog post
    about my Thinkpad if you want to check it out: https://www.yeetpc.com/blog/entry.php'

  body: Still using my X220 with 16GB of RAM and 500 GB SSD.  I get 5ghz wifi though
    by the with factory wireless card.  I was just marveling at how this thing keeps
    going and going, switched over this morning to do some work from my brand new
    Dell desktop, and did a Google search for &quot;still using my X220&quot; and
    your post came out on top.  Once we were trying to watch something with a bluetooth
    speaker and my daughter said, &quot;It seems like your notebook is trusty.&quot;  Well-said!  You
    helped pin down some of the reasons for this.  I think a big part of it is the
    user-serviceability and the connectivity.
